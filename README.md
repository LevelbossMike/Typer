Typer
=====

This is an Ember/Rails blogging application. It uses emberJS for the frontend
and Ruby on Rails for the backend.

This is based on Tom Dale's excellent introductory [screencast to
EmberJS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga99hMi7wfY).

Notes
------
* The ember part of this application is mostly written in Coffeescript.
* The application uses HAML for templating.
* Handlebars templating is done via the
  [Hamlbars](https://github.com/jamesotron/hamlbars)-Gem.
* The application uses Twitter-Bootstrap because I don't know much about CSS.
* There is currently no user authentication. :scream:
